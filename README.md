# SemFlow Frontend

SemFlow Frontend is a React (Vite) based web application for managing semester courses and tracking daily, subject-wise study progress.  
It integrates with a secure JWT-based backend deployed on Render.

This project is built as a **real semester-level full-stack application**, focusing on clean structure, clarity, and extensibility.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- React
- Vite
- React Router v6
- Context API
- Axios
- Plain CSS (single global stylesheet)

---

## 🔗 Backend Integration

The frontend consumes a live backend API deployed on Render:

https://semflow-backend.onrender.com


Backend features include:
- JWT authentication
- Course management
- Daily study logs
- Global error handling
- MongoDB Atlas

The backend is considered **stable and final** for Phase-1.

## 🎨 Styling Rules

- All styling is handled **only in `src/index.css`**
- No component-level CSS files
- No CSS modules
- Minimal inline styles

This keeps the project simple and easy to maintain.

---

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

- User registers or logs in using roll number and password
- JWT token is stored in localStorage
- Token is attached automatically to API requests
- Protected routes are accessible only when authenticated

---

## 🧠 Project Goals

- Build a clean semester management system
- Track daily study activity per course
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Follow real-world full-stack practices
- Keep the system extensible for future features (GPA, analytics, etc.)

---

## 🛠️ Setup & Run Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
Vite will start the app on:
http://localhost:5173
📌 Project Status

Backend: ✅ Completed & Deployed

Frontend: 🚧 In Progress

Phase-1 Scope: Completed

Future Enhancements: GPA, UI polish, mobile responsiveness

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
